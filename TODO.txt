ISC ping component issue?
1. ping package size max limit to 996? why? (indy limit?)
2. sometimes ping not exist IPv4 address may return successful but receive 0 byte (should be an error, indy issue?)

3. Stop/start Do we need to clear ping count?? or use a reset command to reset all count?

4. add support ping multi hosts
5. ping report for each host (Green O, Red X easy to distuction UI)

## report format
1. Host name(& OS version)
2. Wireless card name(& driver version)
3. Target IP
4. continuous ping lost(record)
5. Ping count
6. Ping Fail count
7. Ping Fail Rate (calc by 5 and 6)
8. ttl min
9. ttl max
10. ttl avg (calc by 8 and 9)
11. ping Start time
12. Last ping ok time
13. Ping ok duration (calc by 11 and 12)
. remark

6. Server control all client to do the ping.
	1. client reg to server
	2. server use client list and config client's setting for ping
	3. server ask client start ping
	4. client report ping result in report format
